# Eye Blink Detection with Event Camera Data

This repository contains the code for re-implementing the paper "Real Time Face and Eye Tracking and Blink Detection Using Event Cameras" paper on eye blink detection using event camera data. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect eye blinks in real-time using event camera technology, which provides asynchronous and high-speed visual information.Eye blink detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as driver drowsiness detection, human-computer interaction, and facial expression analysis. In this project, we focus on leveraging event camera data, which provides a stream of asynchronously generated events, to detect eye blinks. By exploiting the high temporal resolution and low latency of event cameras, we aim to achieve accurate and real-time eye blink detection.

## DATASET

Event datasets are usually difficult to come by. We use a synthetically generated dataset called the Neuromorphic Helen dataset. This dataset was generated using Event Simulaators on helen images. These simulators are designed to take in videos as input and output event representation of these. we therefore generated crops of single images of Helen, moved the crop around randomly to simulate a 6-dof camera movement. Follow the steps below to generate the dataset

1. Download [Helen](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~vuongle2/helen/)
2. Generate croppings of single images by running  `python3 Image_Cropping.py`
3. 


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eye-blink-detection.git


2. Install the necessary dependencies (see the next section for details).

3. Download or prepare the event camera dataset:
- If you have an event camera dataset, make sure it is in the appropriate format compatible with the code.
- If you don't have an event camera dataset, you can explore publicly available datasets or generate synthetic data for testing and development purposes.

4. Follow the instructions provided in the project code to preprocess and run the eye blink detection algorithm on your event camera data.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- OpenCV (version X.X.X)
- NumPy (version X.X.X)
- (Add any additional dependencies or libraries used in the project)

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the code, including any specific command-line arguments or configurations. For example:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the command: `python3 main.py --dataset dataset_folder`
   - Replace `dataset_folder` with the path to the folder containing your event camera dataset.
   - Add any additional options or arguments as needed.
3. The program will preprocess the event camera data, apply the blink detection algorithm, and display the results.

## Results

Include any relevant results or performance metrics obtained from running the code. You can also provide visualizations or examples of the output produced by the algorithm.
